# Universal Book Collection

Welcome to Universal Book Collection, a full-stack application project where I manage a collection of books. This project explores building a robust system for tracking and interacting with book data.

## Project Steps

These are the steps I followed to develop the Universal Book Collection platform:

## Choosing Your Data Set

I selected books as the primary dataset for this project to maintain simplicity in data management.

## Building the Database

- Designed a database schema tailored for storing book details.
- Implemented database migrations and seeded initial data to populate the database.

## Building the API

- Developed robust API endpoints to facilitate seamless data retrieval.
- Thoroughly tested API functionality using Insomnia to ensure reliability and accuracy.

## Frontend Development

### Setting the Stage

- Created a React component with static HTML to initialize the frontend interface.

### Building the API Client

- Constructed an efficient API client within the frontend architecture to interact with backend endpoints.

### Querying Data

- Utilized the `useQuery` hook to fetch and display book collection data dynamically.

### Managing Data

#### Create Data

- Introduced a form component to add new books to the collection.
- Implemented data mutation using the `useMutation` hook for creating new entries.

#### Delete Data

- Integrated functionality to delete existing book entries securely.

#### Update Data

- Developed a form component for updating book details.
- Utilized the `useMutation` hook for seamless data updates.

## Stretch Goals

- Ensured form accessibility and usability, complying with keyboard navigation standards.
- Applied CSS styling to enhance the application's visual appeal and user experience.
